# High-level summary of semopy estimates for Bollen’s democracy model (based on bollen_semopy_report/bollen_use_case_report.html)

## Task 1. Interpretation of the estimated structural regressions

Model structure
- dem60 ~ ind60
- dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60

Estimated structural equations (semopy):
- dem60 = 1.435 ind60 + ε1  (Estimate = 1.4345, SE = 0.3848, z = 3.73, p < .001)
- dem65 = 0.507 ind60 + 0.816 dem60 + ε2  (ind60: Estimate = 0.5069, SE = 0.2090, p = .015; dem60: Estimate = 0.8158, SE = 0.1000, p < .001)

What these imply about the model:
- Indirect and direct effects: The 1960 industrialization factor (ind60) has a strong positive effect on 1960 democracy (dem60). In turn, dem60 has a strong positive effect on 1965 democracy (dem65). There is also a smaller but statistically significant direct effect of ind60 on dem65, above and beyond dem60. Together, this implies both a mediated pathway (ind60 → dem60 → dem65) and a residual direct pathway (ind60 → dem65).
- Substantive reading: Countries with higher industrialization in 1960 tended to be more democratic in 1960. That earlier level of democracy, in turn, strongly predicts democracy in 1965. Even accounting for prior democracy, there remains a modest direct association between industrialization and later democracy—consistent with the idea that development has both contemporaneous and lagged influences on democratic outcomes.
- Magnitude: The coefficient for dem60 → dem65 (~0.82) is larger than ind60 → dem65 (~0.51), emphasizing the stability/inertia of democracy across time (state dependence). The positive dem60 ← ind60 path (~1.44) indicates a strong contemporaneous linkage between industrialization and democracy in 1960.

## Task 2. Estimated measurement equations (CFA) from semopy

Notation: Each indicator is expressed as Indicator = Loading × Latent + error. In this solution, reference indicators are fixed to 1.000 (x1 for ind60, y1 for dem60, y5 for dem65), so latent factors are on those indicators’ scales. All reported loadings are unstandardized.

Industrialization 1960 (ind60):
- x1 = 1.000 ind60 + e_x1  (fixed reference)
- x2 = 2.180 ind60 + e_x2  (Estimate = 2.1804, SE = 0.1387, p < .001)
- x3 = 1.819 ind60 + e_x3  (Estimate = 1.8188, SE = 0.1520, p < .001)

Democracy 1960 (dem60):
- y1 = 1.000 dem60 + e_y1  (fixed reference)
- y2 = 1.388 dem60 + e_y2  (Estimate = 1.3876, SE = 0.1875, p < .001)
- y3 = 1.053 dem60 + e_y3  (Estimate = 1.0529, SE = 0.1608, p < .001)
- y4 = 1.368 dem60 + e_y4  (Estimate = 1.3677, SE = 0.1532, p < .001)

Democracy 1965 (dem65):
- y5 = 1.000 dem65 + e_y5  (fixed reference)
- y6 = 1.317 dem65 + e_y6  (Estimate = 1.3170, SE = 0.1801, p < .001)
- y7 = 1.326 dem65 + e_y7  (Estimate = 1.3259, SE = 0.1741, p < .001)
- y8 = 1.391 dem65 + e_y8  (Estimate = 1.3911, SE = 0.1713, p < .001)

Comments:
- All freely-estimated loadings are positive and statistically significant, supporting the intended measurement of the three latent constructs.
- Using x1, y1, and y5 as reference indicators sets the latent scales and allows direct comparability of the other loadings.

## Task 3. High-level explanation of fit indices

From bollen_use_case_report.html (semopy fit indices):
- Degrees of freedom (df): 37
- Chi-square: 50.835 (p = 0.064)
- CFI = 0.980; TLI = 0.970; NFI = 0.930
- GFI = 0.930; AGFI = 0.897
- RMSEA = 0.071
- Information criteria: AIC = 56.644, BIC = 123.852

Interpretation:
- Overall chi-square (χ²) tests exact fit; p = .064 is slightly above .05, which does not reject the model. Given sample size (n = 75) and df = 37, this suggests acceptable exact-fit performance, though χ² is sensitive to distributional assumptions and sample size.
- Incremental fit indices (CFI/TLI near or above .95 are typically considered very good): CFI = 0.98 and TLI = 0.97 both indicate very good comparative fit relative to the null baseline model. NFI = 0.93 also points to strong improvement over the baseline.
- Absolute fit indices: GFI = 0.93 and AGFI = 0.897 indicate good-to-adequate absolute fit (AGFI slightly below 0.90 is often considered borderline but close).
- RMSEA: 0.071 is commonly interpreted as close to acceptable fit (often 0.05–0.08 range is “reasonable” fit). Given the χ² p-value and other indices, the model’s overall fit can be considered good to very good for many applied standards.
- AIC/BIC: Useful for comparing non-nested models fit to the same data; smaller is better. In isolation, they simply document model complexity-penalized fit for future comparisons.

## Task 4. Correlated residuals across time for same-type indicators

The model includes residual covariances between the same indicators measured at two time points (1960 vs. 1965):
- y1 ~~ y5: Estimate = 0.892, SE = 0.367, z = 2.43, p = 0.015 (significant)
- y2 ~~ y6: Estimate = 1.896, SE = 0.762, z = 2.49, p = 0.0128 (significant)
- y3 ~~ y7: Estimate = 1.272, SE = 0.624, z = 2.04, p = 0.041 (significant)
- y4 ~~ y8: Estimate = 0.139, SE = 0.464, z = 0.30, p = 0.764 (not significant)

### Interpretation and comments:
- Allowing these residual covariances acknowledges that the same indicator at two time points can share indicator-specific, time-invariant influences not fully captured by the latent democracy factors (e.g., method effects, stable measurement bias, or content overlap).
- Three of the four cross-time residual correlations (y1–y5, y2–y6, y3–y7) are statistically significant and positive, supporting the idea of stable indicator-specific effects. The y4–y8 residual covariance is small and not significant, suggesting less evidence of indicator-specific carryover for that pair.
- Modeling these residual correlations typically improves fit without conflating them with the latent constructs; they are treated as measurement-level associations rather than substantive structural relations.

### Additional notes
- Structural disturbance variances: Var(ε1) for dem60 is estimated at 3.679 (p < .001); Var(ε2) for dem65 is 0.350 (p = 0.062), indicating substantial unexplained variance for dem60 and marginal residual variance for dem65 after accounting for ind60 and dem60.
- Latent variance of ind60 is 0.449 (p < .001), given x1 fixed loading = 1.000.
