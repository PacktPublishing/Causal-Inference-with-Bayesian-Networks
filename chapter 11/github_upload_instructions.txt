# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Authentication Issue
GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. Instead, you need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) or SSH key.

## Option 1: Using a Personal Access Token (Recommended for quick setup)

1. Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub.com and log in
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select "Settings"
   - Scroll down and select "Developer settings" from the left sidebar
   - Select "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"
   - Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name
   - Select the necessary scopes (at minimum, select "repo")
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again!)

2. Use the token for authentication:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/PacktPublishing/Causal-Inference-with-Bayesian-Networks.git
   ```
   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR_TOKEN with the personal access token you generated.

3. Push your changes:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using SSH Authentication (Better for long-term use)

1. Check if you already have an SSH key:
   ```
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   ```

2. If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Follow the prompts to complete the key generation.

3. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. Add your SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard:
     ```
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
     ```
   - Go to GitHub.com and log in
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select "Settings"
   - Select "SSH and GPG keys" from the left sidebar
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give your key a descriptive title
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field
   - Click "Add SSH key"

5. Change your remote URL to use SSH:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:PacktPublishing/Causal-Inference-with-Bayesian-Networks.git
   ```

6. Push your changes:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
